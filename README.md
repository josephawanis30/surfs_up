## Overview of the analysis:

overview:
As we look to open a Surf & Ice cream shop in Hawaii, we will be focusing on the
months of June & December.  The focus is to project the weather temperatures during 
those months to assess if the shop will operate with success during the different temperature 
patterns.


## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.

* The Minimum Temp(s) between the two months are June (64) & Dec (56) the variance in the temp may seem less suitable for the shop to operate at high compacity of probability.

* The Average Temp(s) between the two months are June (75) & Dec (71) a smaller variance in the temp which means a higher success rate on average for returns.

* The Maximum Temp(s) between the two months are June (85) & Dec (83) would be the ideal weather for the max success rate and above average returns.

Letâ€™s keep our fingers crossed for above Average weather.

## Summary: 
To fully capture the Picture of the Success rate of opening a Surf & Ice cream shop, we must do a more thorough assessment of the area in which the shop wants to open.  More
queries need to be run to decide in what area would the new location be built for higher rate of success.
