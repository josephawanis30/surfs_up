## Overview of the analysis:

overview:
As we look to open a Surf & Ice cream shop in Hawaii, we will be focusing on the
months of June & December.  The focus is to project the weather temperatures during 
those months to assess if the shop will operate with success during the different temperature 
patterns.


## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.
*The Minimum Temp(s) between the two months are June (64) & Dec (56) the variance in the temp may seem less suitable for the shop to operate at high compacity of probability.
*The Average Temp(s) between the two months are June (75) & Dec (71) a smaller variance in the temp which means a higher success rate on average for returns.
*The Maximum Temp(s) between the two months are June (85) & Dec (83) would be the ideal weather for the max success rate and above average returns.
Let’s keep our fingers crossed for above Average weather.

## Summary:
