## Overview of the analysis:

overview:
As we look to open a Surf & Ice cream shop in Hawaii, we will be focusing on the
months of June & December.  The focus is to project the weather temperatures during 
those months to assess if the shop will operate with success during the different temperature 
patterns.


## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables.
Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
